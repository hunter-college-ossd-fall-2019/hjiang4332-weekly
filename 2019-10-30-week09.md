# Eric Raymond's The Cathedral and the Bazaar response  
what are the three concepts from that book that most impressed you?



# Project description
The project that I am working on is called 30 seconds of CSS. Personally, I love when everything looks great and is positioned correctly, so CSS was the perfect language to suit my needs. Thus, I wanted to find a repository that was based around the language. After searching through tons of different repositories, I managed to find 30 seconds of c++. After rummaging their website and seeing what they had to offcer, I realized that it was something achieveable that I could do. I was looking through their website and their code to see if I could find any spelling errors and I found one for their about page. Although that is accepted as a contribution, I want to push myself to contribute a snippet myself.
