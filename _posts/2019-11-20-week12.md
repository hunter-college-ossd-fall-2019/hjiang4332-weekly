# Voting fraud open source solution article response


# Project Contribution update 
I searched a good hour and a half for projects that were beginner/first time friendly. Ive looked into HTML/CSS/Javascript portions of the labels: beginner/first time but I still couldn't find anythin that appealed to me. Thus, I just looked for something really easy so that I could at least get that pull request done. Here is the link to my [pull request](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/pull/23558)

# Weekly Recap:

* Learned about humanitarian projects base off open source
* Got reported by a false positive on wikipedia for edit - did two smaller wiki edits
