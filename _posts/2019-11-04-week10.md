# Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert
What bothered me from the article by Dries Buytaert came from the second sentence: "Most people know that Open Source provides better quality software, at a lower cost, without vendor lock-in." Although I can agree for the most part, this statement implies that most people know open source is the best, while the rest don't know it yet. I can see why the statement can be true, but I can also see how closed source software can be better in certain situations, such as how support in terms of bugs are handled professionlly for closed source software, while open source software needs to depend on the loyal and engaged community in order to provide said support.  

There isn't much that I disagree with on the document, but a slight urk I had with it was the fact that it takes over half the blog to even address a singular problem that was brought up. Governace, privitization, and centralization was brought up near the start of the blog, but it takes until halfway through the blog, after the makers and takers talk, after the prisoner's dilemma talk, after the public vs common good talk to finally start being addressed. There was also the whole explanation about takers being bad for open source, but no solutions were proposed until way later as well. It could be a way for the blog to keep the reader interested and to continue reading, but on my side it was slightly annoying to have to wonder until I got to the good part.  

I get that centralizing a common good, making the government take over maintainance, is a solution to the whole free-rier problem, but it doesn't feel like a good one. It feels like the rights to the open source project is handed over to the government in situations like these, and creators would obviously want to keep at least their name in the rights. The explanation later on was much better when it talks about how companies would create a contract to see how much they should split between one another, though i'm not too sure why the taker company would agree to something like this, since they could just not follow through and earn more money that way.  

All in all I enjoyed the article as it broadened my view on open source. It showed me how complicated things can get once open source software gets larger and larger, and it highlighted all of the little problems open source projects face to establish a correct method.
