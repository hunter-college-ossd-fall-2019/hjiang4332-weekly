# Kevin Fleming visit response

# Update on first contribution
Just like from last week, I have done my first contribution in the form of a css snippet for the repository: 30-seconds-of-css. My pull request is currently still active but there has been no responses to it at all. I don't really have anything else I can say about this so here is the link to the contribution again: [contribution](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-css/pull/168)
